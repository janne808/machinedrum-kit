# DSP1 audio path

DSP1 turns the 16 raw voice blocks into the six codec outputs. Custom machines
do not modify DSP1, but a machine designer needs to know:

- what happens to its output afterwards;
- how DSP1's own deadline depends on DSP2's timing.

All addresses are DSP1 word addresses.

## Block scheduler

```text
wait until ADC DMA0 destination (DDR0) reads exactly 0x13F or 0x17F   # P:0x3C-0x43
    0x13F -> input half X:0x100, output half X:0x400
    0x17F -> input half X:0x140, output half X:0x4C0
block start (P:0x4F)
for each of the 16 voices, in arrival order:
    wait until DMA4 (ESSI0 RX) has received 32 more words             # P:0x73-0x79
    before the last voice: copy the previous master block             # P:0x7D -> P:0x270
        X:0x180 -> X:0x688 and start its DMA back to DSP2
    run the track chain on that voice (P:0x7E-0x25D, padded to fixed length)
clear the next DAC half; route/mix; master effects; dynamics          # P:0x294-0x980
meters                                                                 # P:0x981-0x9A5
bra 0x3C                                                               # P:0x9A8
```

Three properties matter for custom work.

**The block start is an exact-match poll.** If DSP1 returns to `P:0x3C` after
DDR0 has moved past `0x13F`/`0x17F`, it waits for the **next** boundary. A whole
block is skipped: the DAC replays a stale half (192 words) and the mixer period
doubles. This is how a deadline miss shows up.

**The voice link paces DSP2.** DSP2 sends each voice block (32 words) with
DMA0 over ESSI0 and waits for the previous block's transfer before starting the
next. One transfer takes 32 words × 96 cycles = 3,072 DSP2 cycles, so DSP2 can
deliver at most one voice per 3,072 cycles, whatever the renders cost (see the
[voice-link slot floor](08-dsp2-voice-abi.md#the-voice-link-slot-floor)).

**DSP1's work includes waiting for DSP2.** DSP1's own processing is about 59k
cycles per block. It cannot finish until the last voice has arrived, so a late
DSP2 pass eats DSP1's slack: measured about 14.7k cycles typical, 11k at worst
with 15 heavy custom voices. DSP2 overruns therefore surface as DSP1 missing
its block start.

**The host-command ISR busy-waits.** DSP1's host ISR (`P:0x9AA`) reads a
destination, programs DMA5, then **spins inside the interrupt** until the
ColdFire sends the count word (`P:0x9AF`). It runs about 7 times per block; on
hardware the wait is a few cycles. It matters in emulation
(see [emulation and verification](16-emulation-and-verification.md#interleave-quantum)).

## Track chain

Per track `t`, state `T = Y:0x200 + 0x40·t`. The order in the code is:

| Stage | Code | Controls (DSP1 Y) | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Filter parameter prep | `P:0xA4–0xBC` | base `T+4`, width `T+5`, Q `T+6` | Derives two edges and Q |
| Amplitude modulation | `P:0xBD–0xD1` | depth `T+0`, frequency `T+1` | Table oscillator over the 32,768-word sine table |
| Track EQ | `P:0xD2–0x134` | frequency `T+2`, gain `T+3` | Recursive single band, coefficients built on the DSP |
| Track filter | `P:0x135–0x21E` | from prep | Two-edge recursive filter with coefficient interpolation across the block |
| Sample-rate reduction | `P:0x21F–0x233` | `T+7` | Accumulator-driven sample and hold |
| Distortion | `P:0x234–0x25D` | `T+8` | Table-driven, stateful |
| Padding | `P:0x25E–0x26E` | | Fixed timing per track |

These controls arrive as the 7-bit knob value with about 7 extra fractional
bits (`value << 7`). The ColdFire smooths them across blocks.

## Mixing and routing

`Y:0x100 + 5·t` holds route, volume, pan, reverb send and delay send.

- **MAIN-routed tracks** are packed into processed-voice buffers growing up from
  `X:0x200`. A **generated** mixer at `P:0x9E2` sums them into three stereo
  buses: dry `X:0x180`, reverb send `X:0x1C0`, delay send `X:0x600`. The
  generator (`P:0x294–0x31B`) emits two multiply-accumulate instructions per MAIN
  track, then the tail and loop end. It rewrites the code every block. This is
  the only self-modifying code found in the firmware.
- **Mono-routed tracks** (outputs A–F) are packed downward from `X:0x3E0` and
  accumulated directly into their DAC slot. They skip pan, sends and all master
  processing.

| Route | Output | Offset in the six-word DAC frame |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | A | 2 |
| 1 | B | 5 |
| 2 | C | 1 |
| 3 | D | 4 |
| 4 | E | 0 |
| 5 | F | 3 |
| 6 | MAIN | 2 and 5 |

## Master effects

| Effect | Code | Parameters | Structure |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Rhythm Echo delay | `P:0x342–0x43B` | `Y:0x150–0x158`, state to `0x165` | Two external delay lines, 97,020 words apart. Modulated read, cross-feedback, two feedback filters inside the loop. |
| Gate Box reverb | `P:0x43C–0x66B` | `Y:0x185–0x18C` | Predelay ring, 5-stage allpass diffusion, 6-line feedback network, gate, HP/LP return filters |
| Return sum | `P:0x66C–0x67B` | | dry + delay return + reverb |
| Master EQ | `P:0x67C–0x87E` | `Y:0x170–0x179` | Low shelf, high shelf, parametric, output gain |
| Dynamics | `P:0x87F–0x980` | `Y:0x17A–0x184` | Stereo-linked energy detector, 16-frame look-ahead ring, parallel mix |

The completed master pair is added into DAC offsets 2 and 5 on top of any
mono A/B tracks. During the next block (before its last voice) the master
block is copied to `X:0x688` and sent back to DSP2; that feeds RAM recording.

## Links and DMA (both DSPs)

| Channel | Direction | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| DSP2 DMA0 | `Y:0x100/0x120` → ESSI0 TX | One voice block |
| DSP1 DMA4 | ESSI0 RX → `Y:0x600–0x7FF` | 512 voice words per pass |
| DSP1 DMA2 | `X:0x688–0x6C7` → ESSI0 TX | Master block back to DSP2 |
| DSP2 DMA2 | ESSI0 RX → `X:0x700–0x7FF` | Master return ring, pointer `X:0x243` |
| DSP1 DMA0 | ESSI1 RX → `X:0x100–0x17F` | ADC input; its position paces DSP1's blocks |
| DSP2 DMA1 | ESSI1 RX → `X:0x100–0x1FF` | ADC ring for INP and RAM machines |
| DSP1 DMA1 | `X:0x400–0x57F` → ESSI1 TX | Six-channel DAC stream, double buffered |
| DMA5 (both) | HI08 RX → host-selected Y address | ColdFire control packets |
